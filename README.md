# A piece of Art as big as India
An augmented reality sculpture accessible via the WWW, SMS and Mobile Devices.

[Blog posts](http://joelgethinlewis.com/category/projects/a-piece-of-art-as-big-as-india/) about the project.

[Demonstration code](https://jgl.github.io/APieceOfArtAsBigAsIndia/) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This project is built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main platform I am using is [A-Frame](http://a-frame.io/).

My development environment as follows:

* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) – a web framework for node that enables you to write web applications – which is what I’ll need to enable users to load my sculpture and alter it themselves within a mobile webpage.
* [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) – tool that reloads your node server automatically when it detects any changes in your code.
* [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) – a templating engine for node that enables you to write HTML in a simpler way, without having to worry about closing tags and other complications.
* [Less](http://lesscss.org/) – a pre-processor for CSS that makes it much easier to use.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) – a tool for automation that enables the automatic use of tools like Pug, Less and many others.
* [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) – a tool that automatically reloads your web browser when it detects changes in your source code.
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) - a tool for bringing together lots of different JavaScript source files into one.

You can find out more about how I set up the project in the following two blog posts:
